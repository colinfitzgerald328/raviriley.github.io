## Tips
The Cal State application requires dates for every AP exam (MM/DD/YYYY), which can be found for current and past years [here](https://www.totalregistration.net/AP-Exam-Registration-Service/AP-Exam-Schedule.php).

USC has a Dec 1 application deadline if you want to be eligible for scholarships.

ASU has an honors college (Barrett) that is ranked well, and you get automatic scholarships of up to $8K just for having a high GPA and SAT score. They also give a lot of credit for APs, allowing you to graduate in 3 years or less. On top of that, if you have enough APs to skip a year, they have a 3+1 program, meaning in 4 years you get your Bachelors *and* Masters degrees.
