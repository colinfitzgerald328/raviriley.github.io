competencies vs skills

a new restriction will be imposed on teams that use the free version of Trello. Moving forward, theyâ€™ll be limited to a maximum of 10 open boards at any given time. (Enterprise and Trello Business Class users get unlimited boards, and existing free teams will be able  to add up to 10 additional boards until May 1, 2019.)
