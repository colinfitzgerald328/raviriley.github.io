# stuff I wish I knew before senior year and other advice

Sophomore and junior year grades matter the most.

College applications are due at the end of first semester senior year. UC apps are due at the end of November, and many schools have a deadline around January 1st. Some colleges don't even look at your first semester grades when calculating your GPA.

Everything you want to include on college apps must be done before November of your senior year.

Remember that many schools have their own ways of calculating GPA, so Google their specific calculators to get a better idea of where you stand.

### Extracurriculars
**Colleges want a well-rounded class, not a class of well-rounded individuals.** Don't take a bunch of random extracurriculars to pad your college application.

Focus your activities on a few passions (1 to 2 ideally) and go really in depth on them, doing activities at a high level.

Quit all sports after sophomore year (2 year PE requirement) unless you plan on doing that sport in college or you are really good at it (champion at some level, ideally state or national level). Spend the time on your passion-related extracurriculars instead.

Do a few things and do them really well over doing many things and being okay at all of them. Do not spread yourself too thin.

If you are exceptionally good at something, do something that shows you are exceptional at it. For example, of you are really good at math, go win a math competition.

### SAT
Take your first SAT in your sophomore year of high school. This gives you 2 years to work your way up to the score you want. Also, getting the SAT out of the way early on is just one less thing you have to worry about junior/senior year, you will be busy enough as it is.

If any of the schools you are even *considering* applying to recommend SAT Subject Tests, take them as early as you can. Again, one less thing you'll have to worry about.

Don't disregard the PSAT as useless - try to do well on it junior year. Some colleges will give you scholarships and stuff if you get a great (near 1520) score.

### Letters of Recommendation
**Ask your teachers for letters of recommendation as early as you can**, ideally first week of school senior year. At the very least ask before October of senior year. They are not paid to write your letter. They are doing you a favor, make it easier for them. Give them anything that will help them help you. For example:
- resume
- transcript
- list of extracurriculars
- special achievements (especially subject related, if you won a math competition you should tell your math teacher so they can include it in your letter of recommendation)
- what major you have chosen
- what schools you are applying to
- the motto of your dream school or a specific phrase you want them to include (less important than the others)
- etc

You don't need to have all of these of course, but the more the better. Especially at a big school like CV, if your teachers can cite specific things about you in their letters, you will stand out compared to your peers.

Ask your teacher where they went to college. If you are applying to their alma mater, tell them!

UCs don't take letters of recommendation.

Most schools limit the number of letters you can submit. If they don't, that doesn't mean you should submit a ton of letters. No one wants to read all that.
